# Deyzeria's Luck Roll

A quick and simple module for DnD5e for implementing a Luck roll from a new unique Luck Score. The Stat in question is defined on Player Characters actor sheets (Compatible with both the new v2 Character Sheet and Tidy Sheet). Clicking on the title rolls the die as defined in the settings (any amount of faces, however defaulted to d100), and then compares it against the Luck Score. 

By default it compares against the number, attempting to roll below it, e.g. with Luck 15, die needs to result with 15 or below. Alternatively in the settings you can change it to be Above- in such a case, it will check for if it's higher than die size - Ability value. For example with d100 and Luck of 15, it will attempt to roll equal to or above 85 (100-15). It will output the roll into chat, both the default Foundry implementation of count successes, and into flavor text, the roll total and Luck Result in text format, Success/Failure.
